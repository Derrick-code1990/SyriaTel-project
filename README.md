# SyriaTel-project

## Data understanding
**Background Information**

SyriaTel is a telecom provider that offers its clients broadband and mobile services. Retaining clients is essential to sustaining income and profitability for many companies in the telecom sector.

**Main Objective**

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive classifier that can identify customers who are likely to stop using SyriaTel's services. The insights gained from this model will enable the company to intervene proactively, offering personalized solutions to retain customers before they churn.
